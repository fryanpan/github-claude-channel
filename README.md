# github-claude-channel

A Claude Code plugin that delivers GitHub events — CI results, PR reviews, merges, and deploys — as live channel notifications into your running CLI session.

No webhooks. No public URL. Uses your existing `gh` credentials.

## What you get

While you're coding, events arrive automatically:

```
✅ CI success on `owner/repo` (`main` @ a1b2c3d)

👀 Review requested on `owner/repo`: **Add retry logic**

🔀 PR #42 merged on `owner/repo`: **Add retry logic**

🚀 Deploy CI success on `owner/repo` (a1b2c3d @ `main`)
  https://github.com/owner/repo/actions/runs/...
```

When a PR merges, the server automatically watches for a deploy workflow to complete — polling every 30 seconds for up to 30 minutes. Multiple PRs merging in parallel are each tracked independently.

## Events

| Event | Notification |
|-------|-------------|
| CI passes / fails | ✅/❌ check suite completed |
| PR merged | 🔀 |
| PR closed without merging | 🚫 |
| Review requested | 👀 |
| Mention / comment | 💬 |
| Deploy workflow completed | 🚀/💥 (triggered by merge) |

## Requirements

[bun](https://bun.sh) — the server uses `bun:sqlite` and other Bun APIs, so node is not a
substitute. You do not need bun on your `PATH`: the plugin ships a `/bin/sh` launcher that
finds bun itself, so it works in sessions started by launchd, a GUI app, or cron, where
your shell profile never runs.

The first launch resolves `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` through bun's automatic install, so
it needs network access once. Subsequent launches run from bun's cache, offline.

## Install

```bash
claude plugin install github:fryanpan/github-claude-channel
```

Then put your GitHub token where the launcher will find it:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/github-claude-channel
cat > ~/.config/github-claude-channel/env <<'EOF'
export GITHUB_TOKEN=github_pat_...
EOF
chmod 600 ~/.config/github-claude-channel/env
```

The token needs `repo` scope (for reading notifications and action runs). No
`admin:repo_hook` needed.

This file lives outside the plugin directory on purpose. The plugin cache is keyed by
version, so each release installs into a fresh directory — anything you write inside the
plugin is orphaned by the next upgrade. Any environment variable from the table below can
go in here.

## Setup

```
watch_repo auto    # detects the repo from your working directory, or specify "owner/repo"
```

Call this once per session. A session starts out watching nothing and says so, which is
deliberate: it used to auto-watch at startup, and because the MCP server runs from the
plugin's own install directory, every session on the machine silently subscribed to *this*
repo instead of the one it was working in. The watch list then looked populated while no
session was subscribed to anything it cared about.

If the plugin can't tell which directory you're in, `auto` says so rather than guessing —
pass `cwd` (an absolute path) or the `"owner/repo"` explicitly.

## How it works

A **broker daemon** runs once per user (started automatically). It polls `/notifications` every 5 seconds and `/actions/runs` every 30 seconds when a deploy watch is active. Each Claude Code session connects to the broker and receives events for the repos it's watching.

Multiple sessions on the same machine all receive events — each session independently subscribes to repos, and the broker fans out deliveries.

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `watch_repo` | Watch a repo (`"auto"` detects it from the calling session's working directory) |
| `unwatch_repo` | Stop watching a repo |
| `list_watched` | Show repos this session is watching |
| `show_status` | Show broker health, sessions, and active deploy watches |

## Env vars

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | — | PAT with `repo` scope |
| `GITHUB_CHANNEL_PORT` | `7902` | Broker port (change if 7902 is taken by another user) |
| `GITHUB_CHANNEL_SESSION_CWD` | — | Set by the launcher, not by you: the directory the session was started in, captured before the launcher `cd`s to the plugin directory. This is what `watch_repo("auto")` detects from. |

## Multi-user

Each Mac user gets their own broker process using their own token and home directory. If two users need to share port 7902, the second user sets `GITHUB_CHANNEL_PORT=7903` in their shell profile.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fryanpan/github-claude-channel
cd github-claude-channel
bun install
GITHUB_TOKEN=... bun broker.ts   # start broker
bun server.ts                    # start MCP server (in another terminal)
curl http://localhost:7902/state # inspect broker state
```
