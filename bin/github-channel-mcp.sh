#!/bin/sh
# Launcher for the github-claude-channel MCP server.
#
# Why this exists — two separate failures, both fixed here.
#
# 1. PATH. plugin.json used to say `"command": "bun"`, which only works when bun
#    happens to be on the launching process's PATH. bun installs to ~/.bun/bin,
#    which is on PATH only because ~/.zshrc puts it there. Verify with:
#
#        env -i PATH=/usr/bin:/bin sh -c 'command -v bun'   # finds nothing
#
#    So any session not launched from an interactive shell (launchd, a GUI app,
#    cron, a non-login shell) died at spawn with a bare
#
#        Connection failed (ENOENT): Executable not found in $PATH: "bun"
#
#    and from inside the session the plugin was simply absent. /bin/sh is the one
#    interpreter guaranteed to be present, so it does the resolution itself
#    instead of trusting the inherited environment. Resolving at runtime (rather
#    than hardcoding an absolute path) also survives a bun reinstall or upgrade.
#
# 2. Dedup. Claude Code keys plugin-MCP dedup on the command shape — literally
#    `stdio:` + JSON.stringify([command, ...args]). All three channel plugins
#    declared the identical ["bun", "./server.ts"], so the second and third were
#    silently suppressed as duplicates of the first:
#
#        Suppressing plugin MCP server "plugin:notion-channel-mcp:notion-channel":
#          duplicates earlier plugin server "plugin:github-claude-channel:..."
#
#    Referencing this script through ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} makes the argv
#    distinct per plugin. The script filename is distinct too, so the key stays
#    distinct even if placeholder expansion ever moved after the dedup pass.
#
# It also exports the resolved bun on PATH, because server.ts spawns the broker
# as a child process — without this, that child would hit failure #1 all over
# again one level down.
#
# Usage: /bin/sh github-channel-mcp.sh <path-to-server.ts> [args...]

set -u

# Hand the session's cwd to the server BEFORE we leave it.
#
# The cd near the end of this script means the server's own process.cwd() is
# the plugin's install directory, identical for every session on the machine.
# Deriving "which repo is this session in" from it therefore answered with the
# plugin's OWN repo for everybody -- watch_repo("auto") handed each caller
# fryanpan/github-claude-channel no matter where it was called from, and the
# resulting watch list looked correct while subscribing nobody to anything.
# See shared/session-cwd.ts.
